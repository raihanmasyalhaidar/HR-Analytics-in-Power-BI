## Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the organization's workforce metrics, including employee distribution, attrition trends, performance tracking, and demographic insights. It is built using Power BI to enable HR professionals and management to make data-driven decisions efficiently. The dashboard is divided into four main sections: Overview, Demographics, Performance Tracker, and Attrition Analysis. Each section is designed to highlight critical aspects of the workforce, from employee retention to job satisfaction.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to leverage data visualization tools like Power BI to streamline HR analytics and foster strategic decision-making. This includes identifying trends in employee attrition, assessing demographic diversity, monitoring individual and team performance, and evaluating key factors that influence job satisfaction and organizational stability. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance HR management practices and create actionable strategies to improve employee retention and satisfaction.

## Summary
The Overview section presents key metrics, such as the total number of employees (1,470), active employees (1,233), and an attrition rate of 16.1%. It also highlights employee hiring trends over time and the distribution of active employees by department, emphasizing that the Technology department has the highest headcount.

The Demographics section showcases the age range of employees, from 18 to 51 years, and the marital status breakdown. It also analyzes employees by ethnicity and gender, with a comparison of average salaries among different ethnic groups. Gender distribution within age groups highlights potential gaps in representation.

The Performance Tracker offers insights into employee job satisfaction, work-life balance, relationship satisfaction, and managerial ratings over time. This section enables HR to identify patterns in declining or improving satisfaction levels for targeted interventions.

The Attrition section delves into the reasons behind employee turnover. Key metrics include attrition rates by department, job role, travel frequency, tenure, and overtime requirements. For example, frequent travelers and those with higher overtime commitments show higher attrition rates.

## Recommendations
* Enhance Employee Retention Programs: Based on the high attrition rate of 16.1%, focus on tailored retention strategies for departments and job roles with the highest turnover, such as Technology and Sales.
* Address Work-Life Balance Issues: The declining trend in work-life balance satisfaction suggests the need for flexible working hours or remote work policies.
* Strengthen Managerial Support: Low managerial ratings indicate a potential gap in leadership skills. Conduct leadership training programs and improve manager-employee relationships.
* Promote Diversity and Inclusion: The ethnicity salary gap highlights the importance of reviewing compensation policies to ensure equity and fairness across all demographic groups.
* Improve Onboarding Processes: New hires within the first year have higher attrition rates. Strengthen onboarding and mentorship programs to enhance early employee engagement.
* Leverage Predictive Analytics: Integrate machine learning models into the dashboard to predict high-risk employees for proactive retention strategies.
